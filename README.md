# E-RailOpt

This is a computational decision-support tool implemented in Python. The integrated platform combines the energy consumption model, an optimisation algorithm for determining the optimal number and placement of charging stations, and a web-based interface that allows decision-makers to modify locomotive and operational parameters, upload route data, and evaluate charging versus battery-swapping strategies.
